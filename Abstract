In this project the planned to use solar panels to give supply to traffic system and also
focuses on the algorithm for switching the traffic lights according to vehicle density on
road, thereby aiming at reducing the traffic congestion on roads which will help lower the
number of accidents by using artificial intelligence. In recent years, video monitoring and
surveillance systems have been widely used in traffic management for travel information,
ramp metering and updates in real time.
In the present scenario vehicular travel is increasing all over the world, especially in large
urban areas. Therefore for simulating and optimizing traffic control to better
accommodate this increasing demand is arises. In this paper we studied the optimization
of traffic light controller in a city using wireless sensor. We have proposed a traffic light
controller and simulator that allow us to study different situation of traffic density in City.
Using wireless sensor we can easily senses the density of traffic because the general
architecture of wireless sensor network is an infrastructure less communication network.
